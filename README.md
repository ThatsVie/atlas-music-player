## Project Overview

This project was divided into three phases, each focusing on different aspects of building a music player application:

### Phase 1: React Styling

In the first phase, I implemented the design for a music player using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This phase aligned with the "Build a static version" step of the [Thinking in React Process](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react). My goal was to take the provided Figma design and convert it into a fully styled React application.

- **What I Focused On:**

  - Replicating the design exactly as shown in the Figma.
  - Using Tailwind utility classes to create responsive, accessible, and visually dynamic components.
  - Avoiding props, state, or functionality for this phase, as it was focused purely on the UI.

- **Figma Design:** [Atlas Music Player](https://www.figma.com/design/6qiRGbMAIYK7AUoYOCohpq/Atlas-Music-Player?node-id=0-1&p=f)

---

### Phase 2: TypeScript Introduction

In the second phase, I built on the design from Phase 1 by introducing **TypeScript** to implement the functionality of the music player. I leveraged TypeScript's type safety to ensure the code was maintainable and robust while adding interactivity to the app.

- **What I Focused On:**

  - Adding functionality to the components I created in Phase 1 using TypeScript.
  - Applying TypeScript concepts like type safety, null safety, and type inference.
  - Ensuring the player was fully functional and adhered to the Figma design and demo.
  - **Added an Instructions Modal:**  
    - Designed a dynamic instructions modal to guide users on navigating and interacting with the music player.  
    - The modal includes accessibility features like keyboard navigation, mouse interaction, and additional features.  
    - Enabled closing the modal by clicking outside it or using the "Close" button, ensuring intuitive user experience.


- **Figma Design:** [Atlas Music Player](https://www.figma.com/design/6qiRGbMAIYK7AUoYOCohpq/Atlas-Music-Player?node-id=0-1&p=f)
- **Demo from Curriculum:** [Atlas Music Player Demo](https://atlas-music-player.netlify.app/)

---

### Phase 3: React Unit Testing

In the third phase, I focused on writing **unit tests** for the music player app to ensure its functionality and reliability. This phase emphasized creating comprehensive tests for React components, hooks, and APIs using modern testing tools.

- **What I Focused On:**
  - Writing snapshot tests for components to ensure consistent rendering.
  - Testing React components and hooks for proper functionality.
  - Mocking API calls with **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** for reliable tests.
  - Generating code coverage reports to evaluate test quality.
  - Automating testing workflows in GitHub Actions.

### Task 1: Setup Tailwind

#### **Learning Objective**

Learn how to set up Tailwind CSS in a React project.

#### **Resources**

- **[Installing Tailwind](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/tailwind/#installing-tailwind):** Provided in curriculum
- **[Installing Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation):** Official guide to installing Tailwind CSS.

#### **What I Did**

1. **Installed Tailwind CSS:**

   - Ran the following commands to install Tailwind and its peer dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
     npx tailwindcss init -p
     ```

2. **Configured Tailwind:**

   - Updated `tailwind.config.js` to include paths to all template files:
     ```javascript
     /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
     export default {
       content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     };
     ```

3. **Added Tailwind Directives:**

   - Edited `src/index.css` to include the required Tailwind directives:
     ```css
     @tailwind base;
     @tailwind components;
     @tailwind utilities;
     ```

4. **Started the Build Process:**
   - Ran the development server with:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

#### **Result**

Tailwind CSS is successfully set up in the project. The configuration includes paths to template files, and Tailwind directives are added to the CSS file. No custom styles have been added yet; these will be implemented in upcoming tasks.

### Task 2: Basic Components

#### **Learning Objective**

Learn how to style basic components using Tailwind CSS.

#### **Resources**

- **[Common Utility Classes](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/tailwind/#common-utility-classes):** Overview of Tailwind's utility-first classes.
- **[Flexbox Layouts](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/tailwind/#flexbox-layouts):** Guide to building layouts using Flexbox.
- **[Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/):** Icon library used to implement buttons and controls.

#### **What I Did**

1. **Installed Dependencies:**

   - Installed `prop-types` and `lucide-react`:
     ```bash
     npm install prop-types
     npm install lucide-react
     ```
     - **Why `prop-types`:** I initially planned to use this library for type-checking props in components like `PlayListItem`. While I‚Äôm not currently using it, it may be helpful in future tasks when dynamic functionality is implemented.
     - **Why `lucide-react`:** The curriculum specifies using Lucide for icons (e.g., Play, Shuffle, Rewind). While I considered extracting SVGs from the Figma design, using Lucide ensures compliance with the task requirements.

2. **Implemented Static Components:**

   - Built the following components using Tailwind CSS utility classes:
     - `CoverArt`: Displays the cover art image.
     - `SongTitle`: Shows the song title and artist name.
     - `PlayControls`: Includes playback buttons (Speed, Rewind, Play, Fast Forward, Shuffle) using Lucide icons.
     - `VolumeControls`: Contains a volume slider and icon.
     - `PlayListItem`: Displays a song's title, artist, and duration with hover effects.

3. **Used Tailwind for Styling:**

   - Styled all components with Tailwind's utility classes, avoiding plain CSS or inline styles as per the curriculum's requirements.

4. **Set Up Layout for Testing:**

   - Combined the components in `App.jsx` to create a basic layout. This allowed me to visually verify the components and troubleshoot issues.

5. **Troubleshooting Styling and Layout:**
   - I encountered challenges in achieving a pixel-perfect match to the Figma design due to Tailwind's limitations and the curriculum‚Äôs restrictions. For example:
     - Icon colors and button alignment still need refinement.
     - The slider's styling is restricted by Tailwind's utility classes.

---

#### **Result**

The static components are rendered and styled as per the requirements. The layout is functional and matches the general structure of the Figma design. Further adjustments will be made in future tasks as needed.

---

### Task 3: Larger Components

   - **Description:** A composite component that combines a list of `PlayListItem` components and displays the playlist title.
   - **Styling:** Used Tailwind utility classes to create a vertically stacked layout for the playlist. Added hover effects and spacing between items as per the Figma design.

3. **Integration:**

   - These two larger components will be integrated into a higher-level layout in a future task.
   - For now, the focus was on implementing and styling them individually.

4. **Challenges:**
   - **Playlist Component:** Styling the playlist items to match the Figma design while ensuring responsive layout compatibility.
   - **CurrentlyPlaying Component:** Adjusting the layout using Tailwind classes for different screen sizes.

---

#### **Result**

- The `CurrentlyPlaying` component correctly combines and displays the **CoverArt**, **SongTitle**, **PlayControls**, and **VolumeControls** components in a cohesive layout.
- The `Playlist` component uses the **PlayListItem** component to display a list of songs, with spacing and hover effects for better visual clarity.

   - Verified that clicking a song in the playlist updates the currently playing song and its corresponding details.
   - Ensured that playlist items reflect changes when navigating songs using the back/forward controls.

---

#### **Result**

- The `Playlist` component now dynamically displays a list of songs with:
  - Clickable functionality to change the currently playing song.
  - A clear visual indication of the currently selected song.
- The `MusicPlayer` component seamlessly manages state and interactions, ensuring consistent functionality across child components.
- All components are converted to TypeScript for enhanced reliability and developer experience.

### Task 3: Audio Player

#### **Learning Objective**

- Use **React state** to manage an HTML `<audio>` element for audio playback.
- Seamlessly integrate custom playback controls to manage play/pause, volume, and playback speed without relying on the built-in audio element controls.

---

#### **What I Did**

1. **Created the `AudioPlayer` Component:**

   - Built a new component at `src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx` to handle audio playback functionality for the currently selected song.
   - Managed the audio element using the `useRef` hook, ensuring direct access for controlling playback.

2. **Integrated Custom Playback Controls:**

   - Removed reliance on the default audio controls, instead connecting the audio element to the following components:
     - `PlayControls`: To toggle play/pause and manage playback speed.
     - `VolumeControls`: To dynamically adjust the volume.
   - Updated the component to react to changes in playback state (`isPlaying`), volume, and playback speed.

3. **Managed Audio State Dynamically:**

   - Configured the `audio` element to:
     - Play the currently selected song when `isPlaying` is true.
     - Pause playback when `isPlaying` is false.
     - Dynamically update the playback speed and volume in real time using `useEffect`.

4. **Handled Song Changes:**

   - Ensured that the audio source (`songUrl`) updates when a new song is selected.
   - Automatically started playback of the new song when `isPlaying` was true.

5. **Debugging and Testing:**
   - Verified that the audio element plays and pauses correctly based on the `PlayControls` toggle.
   - Confirmed that the volume adjusts smoothly when using the `VolumeControls` slider.
   - Tested that the playback speed dynamically responds to user changes (e.g., 0.5x, 1x, 2x).

---

#### **Result**

- The `AudioPlayer` component:

  - Plays and pauses the currently selected song based on `isPlaying`.
  - Adjusts playback speed and volume dynamically in response to user interaction.
  - Integrates seamlessly with the rest of the `atlas-music-player` application, relying on state managed by `CurrentlyPlaying`.

- Users can now fully control audio playback using the custom UI, making the music player intuitive and functional.

---

### Task 4: Deploy Application

## React Unit Testing Tasks

### **React Unit Testing: Task 0: Getting Started**

#### **Learning Objective**

- Set up the testing environment with **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.
- Understand how to configure a test runner and write basic tests.

#### **What I Did**

1. **Installed and Configured Vitest:**
   - Added Vitest as a dependency to the project.
   - Configured a `test` script in the `package.json` file:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "test": "vitest"
     }
     ```
   - Installed the Vitest VS Code Plugin for an integrated development experience.

2. **Set Up Mocking with MSW:**
   - Integrated Mock Service Worker (MSW) for mocking API calls during tests.
   - Created a `mockServer.ts` file to define API handlers for mocking.

3. **Added React Testing Library:**
   - Used React Testing Library to render and query components in tests.

4. **Ran Initial Tests:**
   - Verified that the testing setup works by writing and running a simple snapshot test.

##### **Result**

- The project is now configured with a robust testing environment.
- Snapshot tests, component tests, and API mocking are all ready to be implemented in future tasks.

---


### Task 1: Snapshot Tests

#### **Learning Objective**

- Learn how to write snapshot tests for React components to ensure UI stability and consistency.
- Understand how to test different combinations of props effectively.

---

#### **What I Did**

1. **Created Snapshot Tests for Components**  
   - Added snapshot tests for the following components:
     - `CoverArt`
     - `PlayListItem`
     - `SongTitle`
     - `VolumeControls`

2. **Tested Prop Variations**  
   - Wrote tests to verify that components render correctly with various combinations of props:
     - For `CoverArt`, tested different image URLs and alt text.
     - For `PlayListItem`, tested combinations of `title`, `artist`, `duration`, and `isCurrent`.
     - For `SongTitle`, tested different title lengths and formats.
     - For `VolumeControls`, tested different initial volume levels and interaction states.

3. **Generated Snapshots**  
   - Used the `@testing-library/react` and `vitest` libraries to render components and generate snapshot files.

4. **Ensured All Tests Pass**  
   - Verified that snapshot tests pass for all components using the `npm run test -- -u` command.

5. **Stored Snapshots**  
   - All snapshots were auto saved in the `src/__tests__/__snapshots__` directory for version control and future comparisons.

---

#### **Result**

- Snapshot tests ensure that UI changes are intentional by catching unintended modifications.
- All components render correctly with various props, maintaining consistency across the application.

---

### Task 2: Mocking

#### **Learning Objective**

- Learn how to mock API calls during unit tests.
- Understand how to use **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** for intercepting and mocking network requests.

---

#### **What I Did**

1. **Setup Mock Service Worker (MSW)**  
   - Installed `msw` as a development dependency using:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev msw
     ```
   - Configured MSW in the `src/mocks` directory:
     - **`handlers.ts`**: Defined mock API routes:
       - `/api/v1/playlist` for fetching playlist data.
       - `/api/v1/songs/:id` for fetching song details.
       - `/api/v1/lyrics/:id` for fetching song lyrics.
     - **`server.ts`**: Set up the MSW server with these handlers.

2. **Integrated MSW with Vitest**  
   - Configured the MSW server in `vitest.setup.ts` to:
     - Start the mock server before running tests.
     - Reset handlers after each test to ensure independence.
     - Stop the server after all tests are complete.

3. **Wrote Unit Tests Using Mocked Data**  
   - Created `src/__tests__/MusicPlayer.test.tsx` to verify that the `MusicPlayer` component renders playlist data from mocked API responses:
     - Mocked `/api/v1/playlist` to return a playlist with two test songs.
     - Used assertions to confirm playlist items (`Test Song 1`, `Test Song 2`) and their artists appear in the document.

4. **Verified Data Mocking and Testing**  
   - Ensured that real API calls are not made during tests and all API responses are replaced with mocked data from MSW.
   - Used the following command to run tests and update snapshots:
     ```bash
     npm run test -- -u
     ```
     - **This command:**
       - Runs all test files using Vitest.
       - Updates snapshots if there are changes to ensure tests reflect the latest UI or component changes.

---

#### **Result**

- **Mocking Achieved**: All API calls in the `MusicPlayer` tests are intercepted and replaced with controlled mocked responses.
- **Component Verified**: The `MusicPlayer` component successfully renders playlist data fetched from the mocked API, ensuring independence from real backend services.
- **Reusable Setup**: The MSW mock server is set up to support further tasks requiring API calls, promoting efficient and isolated testing.


---

### Task 3: React Testing Library

#### **Learning Objective**

- Learn how to write unit tests for React components using **React Testing Library**.
- Understand how to test user interactions and component functionality.

---

#### **What I Did**

1. **Refined Testing Framework**  
   - Used **Vitest** as the testing framework to ensure alignment with project requirements:
     - Imported Vitest utilities like `test`, `expect`, `vi`, and lifecycle hooks (`beforeAll`).
     - Replaced any Jest-specific syntax (e.g., `jest.fn()`) with `vi.fn()` for mocking.

2. **Mocked HTMLMediaElement APIs**  
   - Simulated browser media functionalities that `MusicPlayer` relies on:
     - Mocked `play`, `pause`, `volume`, and `playbackRate` using `vi.fn()` to prevent errors in `jsdom` (test environment).
     - Ensured that methods behave predictably during tests, even without a real DOM.

3. **Enhanced API Mocking with MSW**  
   - Continued leveraging the **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** setup from Task 2:
     - Handlers for API routes (e.g., `/api/v1/playlist`) were reused to provide mock playlist data for tests.
     - Centralized API mocking ensures consistency across tests and tasks.

4. **Implemented Unit Tests for `MusicPlayer`**  
   - **Created Five Unit Tests** in `src/__tests__/MusicPlayer.test.tsx`:
     1. **Default Song**: Verified the first song in the playlist is set as default when the component loads.
     2. **Play/Pause**: Tested toggling play/pause functionality updates the UI as expected.
     3. **Next Song**: Checked that clicking the "Next" button updates the current song to the next one in the playlist.
     4. **Previous Song**: Confirmed that clicking the "Previous" button navigates back to the previous song.
     5. **Song Selection**: Validated that clicking a specific song in the playlist updates the currently playing song.
   - **Bonus Test**: Added an extra test for the **speed toggle button**:
     - Verified that the button cycles through playback speeds correctly (1x ‚Üí 1.5x ‚Üí 2x).

5. **Followed Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**  
   - Structured tests for clarity and maintainability:
     - **Arrange**: Render the `MusicPlayer` component.
     - **Act**: Simulate user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons) with `fireEvent`.
     - **Assert**: Verify the component's updated state using `expect`.

6. **Ensured Independent Tests**  
   - Utilized Vitest lifecycle hooks to:
     - Reset the MSW handlers after each test (`afterEach`).
     - Prevent tests from interfering with one another.

---

#### **How I Ran the Tests**

1. **Run Tests**  
   - Used the following command to execute all tests:
     ```bash
     npm run test
     ```

2. **Verify Output**  
   - Confirmed all tests passed successfully, validating `MusicPlayer` functionality.

---

#### **Result**

- **Test Coverage Expanded**: The `MusicPlayer` component's key functionalities were tested, ensuring it behaves as expected:
  - First song defaults.
  - Play/Pause toggling.
  - Song navigation (Next/Previous).
  - Song selection from the playlist.
  - Playback speed toggling.
- **Reusable Mock Setup**: API mocking with MSW and HTMLMediaElement stubs ensures a scalable testing setup for future tasks.
- **Readable Tests**: The Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and inline comments make the tests easy to understand and maintain.

---


### **Task 4: Code Coverage**

#### **Learning Objective**
- Understand how to check **code coverage** for unit tests written in JavaScript.
- Learn how to generate and interpret code coverage reports in both **VS Code UI** and **CLI**.

---

#### **What I Did**

1. **Ran Coverage Analysis in VS Code**  
   - Used the **Vitest VS Code plugin** to "Run Tests with Coverage."
   - This provided a visual breakdown of tested and untested lines within the **MusicPlayer** component and related files.
   - **Key Note:** The **VS Code coverage report differs from the CLI coverage report** because:
     - VS Code plugin uses an in-editor approach to display coverage.
     - CLI report aggregates coverage across all test files and displays a summary.
   - **Screenshot**: Saved as `coverage-ui.png` in the project root.

2. **Configured CLI Coverage Report**  
   - Added a coverage script to `package.json`:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "coverage": "vitest --coverage"
     }
     ```
   - This allows us to run:
     ```bash
     npm run coverage
     ```
   - The CLI report provides:
     - **Statement Coverage** (`% Stmts`): How many executable statements are tested.
     - **Branch Coverage** (`% Branch`): How many logical branches (`if`, `else`, `switch`) are tested.
     - **Function Coverage** (`% Funcs`): How many functions are executed during testing.
     - **Line Coverage** (`% Lines`): How many lines of code are executed.
   - **Screenshot**: Saved as `coverage-cli.png` in the project root.

3. **Improved Code Coverage by Writing Additional Tests**  
   - Identified **missed lines** in the coverage report.
   - Added **more tests** to improve coverage in:
     - `PlayControls.tsx` ‚Äì Ensured shuffle button toggling worked correctly.
     - `CurrentlyPlaying.tsx` ‚Äì Verified it displayed the expected song information.
   - **Mocking Adjustments**:  
     - Ensured MSW was properly handling API requests to avoid untested scenarios.
     - Added test cases for **API errors** and how the UI responds to failed requests.


5. **Ignored `coverage/` in Git**  
   - Since the **task only required screenshots**, the generated coverage folder was excluded from version control.
   - Added this to `.gitignore`:
     ```
     # Ignore coverage reports
     coverage/
     ```

---

#### **How I Ran the Tests and Coverage Reports**

1. **Run Tests with Coverage in VS Code**
   - Used the **Vitest VS Code Plugin**.
   - Selected "Run Tests with Coverage."
   - Verified the UI breakdown of tested and untested lines.
   - **Saved Screenshot:** `coverage-ui.png`.

2. **Run CLI Coverage Report**
   - Ran the following command:
     ```bash
     npm run coverage
     ```
   - Verified detailed breakdown of statement, branch, function, and line coverage.
   - **Saved Screenshot:** `coverage-cli.png`.

---

#### **Result**

**Achieved Comprehensive Test Coverage**  
- Ensured that `MusicPlayer` and its related components are well-tested.
- Verified code coverage results in **both VS Code UI and CLI**.

**Improved Project Setup**  
- **Added CLI script** (`npm run coverage`) for easy test coverage analysis.
- **Excluded mock files** from coverage reports.

**Screenshots for Submission**  
- `coverage-ui.png` (VS Code Coverage Report)
- `coverage-cli.png` (CLI Coverage Report)

---

### Task 5: Continuous Integration

#### **Learning Objective**
- Automate unit tests and code coverage reports using **GitHub Actions**.

---

#### **What I Did**

1. **Created a GitHub Actions Workflow (`ci.yml`)**  
   - The workflow is stored in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
   - It triggers **automatically** on every push to the `main` branch.

2. **Defined CI Pipeline**
   - The workflow installs dependencies, runs tests, and generates a coverage report.
   - It ensures that all tests must pass before merging new code.

3. **Configured GitHub Actions**
   - Used `actions/checkout` to fetch the latest repository changes.
   - Used `actions/setup-node` to install Node.js version 20.
   - Ran `npm run test` to execute all unit tests.
   - Ran `npm run coverage` to generate the test coverage report.

4. **Verified CI Pipeline Execution**
   - Checked the **Actions tab** in GitHub to confirm successful workflow execution.
   - Ensured the test output and coverage report were generated.

---

#### **How to View the CI Pipeline**
1. **Push any commit to `main`.** The workflow runs automatically.
2. **Check the Actions tab** in the GitHub repository.
3. **View the workflow logs** to see the test results and coverage report.

---

#### **Result**
**Automated testing and coverage reporting are now integrated.**  
**The GitHub Actions workflow ensures all code changes are tested.**  
**The CI pipeline prevents broken code from being merged into the main branch.**
