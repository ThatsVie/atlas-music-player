## Project Overview

This project was divided into two phases, each focusing on different aspects of building a music player application:

### Phase 1: React Styling

In the first phase, I implemented the design for a music player using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This phase aligned with the "Build a static version" step of the [Thinking in React Process](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react). My goal was to take the provided Figma design and convert it into a fully styled React application.

- **What I Focused On:**

  - Replicating the design exactly as shown in the Figma.
  - Using Tailwind utility classes to create responsive, accessible, and visually dynamic components.
  - Avoiding props, state, or functionality for this phase, as it was focused purely on the UI.

- **Figma Design:** [Atlas Music Player](https://www.figma.com/design/6qiRGbMAIYK7AUoYOCohpq/Atlas-Music-Player?node-id=0-1&p=f)

---

### Phase 2: TypeScript Introduction

In the second phase, I built on the design from Phase 1 by introducing **TypeScript** to implement the functionality of the music player. I leveraged TypeScript's type safety to ensure the code was maintainable and robust while adding interactivity to the app.

- **What I Focused On:**

  - Adding functionality to the components I created in Phase 1 using TypeScript.
  - Applying TypeScript concepts like type safety, null safety, and type inference.
  - Ensuring the player was fully functional and adhered to the Figma design and demo.

- **Figma Design:** [Atlas Music Player](https://www.figma.com/design/6qiRGbMAIYK7AUoYOCohpq/Atlas-Music-Player?node-id=0-1&p=f)
- **Demo from Curriculum:** [Atlas Music Player Demo](https://atlas-music-player.netlify.app/)

1. **Installed Tailwind CSS:**

   - Ran the following commands to install Tailwind and its peer dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
     npx tailwindcss init -p
     ```

2. **Configured Tailwind:**

   - Updated `tailwind.config.js` to include paths to all template files:
     ```javascript
     /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
     export default {
       content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     };
     ```

3. **Added Tailwind Directives:**

   - Edited `src/index.css` to include the required Tailwind directives:
     ```css
     @tailwind base;
     @tailwind components;
     @tailwind utilities;
     ```

4. **Started the Build Process:**
   - Ran the development server with:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

#### **Result**

Tailwind CSS is successfully set up in the project. The configuration includes paths to template files, and Tailwind directives are added to the CSS file. No custom styles have been added yet; these will be implemented in upcoming tasks.

### Task 2: Basic Components

#### **Learning Objective**

Learn how to style basic components using Tailwind CSS.

#### **Resources**

- **[Common Utility Classes](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/tailwind/#common-utility-classes):** Overview of Tailwind's utility-first classes.
- **[Flexbox Layouts](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/tailwind/#flexbox-layouts):** Guide to building layouts using Flexbox.
- **[Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/):** Icon library used to implement buttons and controls.

#### **What I Did**

1. **Installed Dependencies:**

   - Installed `prop-types` and `lucide-react`:
     ```bash
     npm install prop-types
     npm install lucide-react
     ```
     - **Why `prop-types`:** I initially planned to use this library for type-checking props in components like `PlayListItem`. While I’m not currently using it, it may be helpful in future tasks when dynamic functionality is implemented.
     - **Why `lucide-react`:** The curriculum specifies using Lucide for icons (e.g., Play, Shuffle, Rewind). While I considered extracting SVGs from the Figma design, using Lucide ensures compliance with the task requirements.

2. **Implemented Static Components:**

   - Built the following components using Tailwind CSS utility classes:
     - `CoverArt`: Displays the cover art image.
     - `SongTitle`: Shows the song title and artist name.
     - `PlayControls`: Includes playback buttons (Speed, Rewind, Play, Fast Forward, Shuffle) using Lucide icons.
     - `VolumeControls`: Contains a volume slider and icon.
     - `PlayListItem`: Displays a song's title, artist, and duration with hover effects.

3. **Used Tailwind for Styling:**

   - Styled all components with Tailwind's utility classes, avoiding plain CSS or inline styles as per the curriculum's requirements.

4. **Set Up Layout for Testing:**

   - Combined the components in `App.jsx` to create a basic layout. This allowed me to visually verify the components and troubleshoot issues.

5. **Troubleshooting Styling and Layout:**
   - I encountered challenges in achieving a pixel-perfect match to the Figma design due to Tailwind's limitations and the curriculum’s restrictions. For example:
     - Icon colors and button alignment still need refinement.
     - The slider's styling is restricted by Tailwind's utility classes.

---

#### **Result**

The static components are rendered and styled as per the requirements. The layout is functional and matches the general structure of the Figma design. Further adjustments will be made in future tasks as needed.

---

### Task 3: Larger Components

   - **Description:** A composite component that combines a list of `PlayListItem` components and displays the playlist title.
   - **Styling:** Used Tailwind utility classes to create a vertically stacked layout for the playlist. Added hover effects and spacing between items as per the Figma design.

3. **Integration:**

   - These two larger components will be integrated into a higher-level layout in a future task.
   - For now, the focus was on implementing and styling them individually.

4. **Challenges:**
   - **Playlist Component:** Styling the playlist items to match the Figma design while ensuring responsive layout compatibility.
   - **CurrentlyPlaying Component:** Adjusting the layout using Tailwind classes for different screen sizes.

---

#### **Result**

- The `CurrentlyPlaying` component correctly combines and displays the **CoverArt**, **SongTitle**, **PlayControls**, and **VolumeControls** components in a cohesive layout.
- The `Playlist` component uses the **PlayListItem** component to display a list of songs, with spacing and hover effects for better visual clarity.
